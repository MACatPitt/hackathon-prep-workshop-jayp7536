# Hackathon Starter Project

This repository is a **skeleton** designed to help you quickly begin a hackathon project without getting stuck on setup.

The goal is **not perfection**, but getting something working that you can build on.



## What This Project Does

Right now, this project:
- Displays a title and description
- Includes a button
- Changes text when the button is clicked

By the end of the workshop, you’ll customize this to reflect *your own idea*.



## How to Run This Project

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. It will open in your browser

### Option 2: VS Code
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Install **Live Server** extension
  - Live Server allows for multiple users to work on the code at the same time
  - Everyone is able to see everyone's real-time changes and contributions
4. Right-click `index.html` --> “Open with Live Server”
5. Another option (instead of Live Share) is everyone working on their own branch



## What You Should Change First

1. Update the project title in `index.html`
2. Rewrite the description to describe:
   - What problem you’re solving
   - Who it helps
   - Why your solution is special
3. Modify `script.js` to add new interactions



## Working in a Team

Use GitHub to:
- Commit small changes
- Track progress
- Show contribution
- Work simultaneously



## Hackathon Tips

- Start simple
  - Focus on the main elements to complete
- A working demo beats an unfinished big idea
- Learn as you go
  - Don't be afraid to go on YouTube for a "how-to" video or ask a mentor walking around!

Happy hacking!!! (Don't you know the grind never stops??)
